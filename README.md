# packTools
This is a repo where I store my scripts that help(ed) to make texture packs

## What do these do?
- `5to47.py` : converts the 5 textures from the `ctm_compact` method to 47 from the `ctm` method, to fix the strange lines in the middle of blocks in lower versions.

P.S: I found [this](https://github.com/ewanhowell5195/ewanhowell5195.github.io/releases) so this is probably never going to be updated
